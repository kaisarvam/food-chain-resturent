        <h5 class="food-image-name">Burger</h5>
        <p>Your new favorite Burger ! There’s nothing like a juicy cheeseburger with fresh crisp toppings on a toasted bun, paired with sweet corn on the cob or potato wedges. We partnered with Beef. It’s What’s for Dinner on behalf of the Beef Checkoff to show you how to make the ultimate juicy burger.</p>

        <img src="images/food/shwarma.jpg" alt="">
        <h5 class="food-image-name">Shwarma</h5>
        <p>This Chicken Shawarma  is going to knock your socks off! Just a handful of every day spices makes an incredible Chicken Shawarma marinade that infuses the chicken with exotic Middle Eastern flavours. The smell when this is cooking is insane!</p>

        <img src="images/food/cheezy_garlic_burger.jpg" alt="">
        <h5 class="food-image-name">Cheezy Garlic Burger</h5>
        <p>These juicy, world famous garlic burgers have just three seasonings and a legion of fans, and are simply one of the very best burgers you’ll every bite into.It’s here! Grilling season is dead set upon us and that’s just one reason I’m happy to partner on this post with Cowboy Charcoal, because just like this recipe, Cowboy Charcoal is a classic.</p>

        <img src="images/food/spicy_chowmin.jpg" alt="">
        <h5 class="food-image-name">Spicy Chicken Chowmin</h5>
        <p>Chicken chow mein is probably already one of your favorite Chinese takeout dishes. This one-pan dinner is so satisfying with chicken, vegetables, classic chow mein noodles, and the best homemade chow mein sauce. Also, it’s way healthier than ordering takeout.</p>
